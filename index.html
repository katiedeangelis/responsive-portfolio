            <p><img src="assets/images/profilepic.png">Welcome! My name is Katie DeAngelis. I attended the University of New
                Hampshire (Durham) and received a dual degree in Anthropology and Pre-Law. After graduation, I began work
                as an Implementation Specialist for Meditech. As an Implementation Specialist for the Emergency Department
                Management (EDM) suite of applications I traveled to hospitals throughout the United States and Canada to
                install, setup, and train front end users on our softwareâ€™s functionality.</p>
            <br>
            <p>After several years at Meditech, I transitioned to a Laboratory Information Systems (LIS) Analyst position at
                a small rural hospital in New Hampshire. As an LIS Analyst I oversee the implementation of updates related
                to Meditech, as well as maintaining other operational hardware, and software components of our lab information
                system. In addition, I ensure that we meet all regulatory and accreditation requirements set forth by our
                governing agencies.</p>
            <br>
            <p>During my time as an analyst, I realized that there seemed to be a gap between functionality in the HIS that
                is being created and the functional need of its clinical users. As an analyst, I am able to marginally mitigate
                this gap by optimizing system usage and in-depth user training, however there are still areas within HIS
                development that need work.</p>
            <br>
            <p>With this in mind and with many HIS vendors making the move to web based platforms, I turned my sites on Full
                Stack Development to help master the languages and skills I would need to help make these systems more efficient,
                intuitive to users, and help to capture critical patient health information. I am currently working towards
                a Full Stack Development certificate through the University of New Hampshire. I anticipate completion of
                the certificate in March of 2018.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In my free time I enjoy reading and Netflix marathons. I have also started listening to a variety of podcasts
                from InfoQ, to One Bad Mother, to NPR Politics. I am a life long learner and I enjoy the ability to hone
                my current skill set and work on new challenges! Feel free to contact me above for additional information
                or connect with me through social media!</p>
